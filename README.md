<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
**Purpose**
- gatewayEdit is a superior tool to tC Create with a better interface
- We need to test if it makes sense to have two repos for the same resource within gE
- We need to know if there are any major blockers to adding a translation mode to gE.

**Problem**
- Currently gatewayEdit app doesn't show the source resources.

**Scope**
- It is possible to show the source view but only the challenging part is - how to manage the space

**Background (Contextual situations)**
- When users want to compare a resource to the English source text
- When users want to translate a resource from the English source text
