# TODO

- Coordinated with Zach and Bruce McLean to meet with the GeCraft team next week to discuss their pull request on some of our RCLs.
- Met with Bruce McLean to talk about the bible reference RCL API.
- Working prompt for unsaved changes to the Bible reference navigation.
- Just one problem with the onPreChange mehtod, it changes the book, chapter or verse even when clicking cancel on the prompt.
